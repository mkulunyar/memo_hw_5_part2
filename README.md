MEMORANDUM

To: Organization of Trump for President

From: Analyst Team

Subject: TRUMP’S LINGUSTIC EFFECTIVENESS 

To begin with, the interesting thing about Trump is that he uses language differently than other politicians, or previous presidents. Although he is aware of the fact that his speech will be fully analyzed and used against him, he comfortably prefers to disregard this truth and speaks simple. Here are the findings: 

•	Basically, Trump favors simple sentences, barely uses complex sentences. He has a range of words that are being used over and over again. Above comparison data frame shows that Trump has the worst word usage compared to Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Trump used average 5 different words in a sentence while Clinton, Bush and Obama have 8 words, 7 words and 9 words respectively. It points out that Trump does not speak as sophisticated as previous presidents. Given that he has competed with amazing speakers such as Bernie Sanders, Trump should work on his wording

•	The most frequently used words are Hillary Clinton, Illegal Immigration, President Obama, Radical Islam, Criminal Alien and Immigration System. For instance, “[…] of the White House Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton weak, weak policies, foolish polices.” this sentence shows that Trump prefers to use attacking, aggressive and even preemptive sentences to make things heated. 

•	Moreover, he usually ends his sentences with strong, punching negative words. What he does is that he frames negative responses as an overreaction. To recall, the sentiment analysis in this homework showed that he used 571 negative and 512 positive words in selected three speeches. The graph in the sentiment analysis showed that the top negative words are illegal, terrorism and criminal while the top positive words are great, work and right. 

•	It seems that the speech in general is not important to him, since he uses the striking words at the end of almost every sentence. It is a really convincing and efficient way of talking. However, the problem is that it is a political scene, it is always expected from the candidates to be sophisticated.  

Trump’s 3 speeches on different subjects were analyzed in terms of word frequency, sentiment, topic modeling and compared to the previous presidents of United States. The result is that Trump prefers to speak much less sophisticated and aggressive. 

The Organization of Trump for President should acknowledge the fact that being calm, assertive and good speaker are must have skills in order to have a successful political career, and provide linguistic support to him during his political career.
